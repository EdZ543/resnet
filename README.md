# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
This is my implementation of the Residual Network architecture in PyTorch as desccribed in the *Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition*.[^1]

It replicates a portion of their CIFAR-10 experiment, as described in section 4.2.

## Setup
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
```
python train.py
```
